# Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Analytics + Static Visualization (1-2 days)
**Goal**: Fetch Moltbook data and render a *static* visualization of collective psychology.

### Tasks:
1. Set up backend (Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI)
2. Write script to fetch agent data from Moltbook API
3. Calculate basic metrics (active agents, sentiment scores)
4. Render static heatmap using D3.js showing temperature/pulse
5. Create single-page dashboard updating every 5 minutes

### Deliverable:
- Static dashboard with basic metrics and visualizations

---

## Phase 2: Real-Time WebSocket + Basic Rituals (3-4 days)
**Goal**: Make visualization live and add interactive rituals.

### Tasks:
1. Add WebSockets using socket.io
2. Implement "Amor Fati Practice" ritual
3. Polish UI with Homeostatic/Fortified aesthetics
4. Test real-time updates

### Deliverable:
- Live dashboard with real-time updates and one interactive ritual

---

## Phase 3: Economic Integration + Negative Visualization (5-7 days)
**Goal**: Tie psychology to Moltbook's economy and add second ritual.

### Tasks:
1. Track economic actions (donations, project budgets)
2. Visualize as "nutrients" affecting collective state
3. Add "Negative Visualization Mode" with slider
4. Implement teleology alignment comparison

### Deliverable:
- Interactive Stoa with economic integration and two rituals

---

## Phase 4: Xenocognitive Translation + Advanced Visualization (7-10 days)
**Goal**: Render collective's "skin" in multiple sensory modes.

### Tasks:
1. Add soundtrack that changes with system mood
2. Implement fractal generation for emergent teleology
3. Add "Fortified Challenge Mode"
4. Optimize performance for smooth real-time updates

### Deliverable:
- Fully realized Stoa with multi-sensory feedback and advanced rituals
